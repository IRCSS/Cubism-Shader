Cubism Effect in Shader in Unity 3D 
=================

In the repo you will find code for achieving a cubist like effect on meshes. The effect is done in vertex shader by adjusting camera view matrix per voronoi segment (created based on world space coordinates), so that each segment is viewed from different perspective. 

I am still not done with the effect, the code is still under construction. I will write a blog post on it later and explain the code and the thought process. To be notified for that either follow me on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/IRCSS) or [medium](https://medium.com/@shahriyarshahrabi)

The mesh is not in the repo, you can grab it on [sketchfab](https://skfb.ly/6xySP). Mesh is from The Hallwyl Museum.
