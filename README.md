Cubism Effect in Shader in Unity 3D 
=================

In the repo you will find code for achieving a cubist like effect on meshes. The effect is done in vertex shader by adjusting camera view matrix per voronoi segment (created based on world space coordinates), so that each segment is viewed from different perspective. 

More info on it in this blog post: https://medium.com/@shahriyarshahrabi/real-time-cubism-shader-5c8e0c79195c

The mesh is not in the repo, you can grab it on [sketchfab](https://skfb.ly/6xySP). Mesh is from The Hallwyl Museum.
